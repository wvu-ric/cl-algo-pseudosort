#Pseudocode a Sorting Algorithm

Algorithms are fundamental to coding and sorting is fundamental to algorithms. In this exercise, we're going to implement a simple sorting algorithm using pseudocode. With pseudocode, there is no such thing as invalid syntax. But remember! Every line of your "code" should translate into a single, direct programming statement.

**Input:** An unsorted array of n numbers

**Output:** A sorted (least to greatest) array n of numbers

**Description:**

1. Start at the end of the list and get the last element: A[n]

2. Compare that element to the one before it. A[n-1]

3. If A[n] < A[n-1] , then swap the two elements

4. Repeat this step until the first element, A[0] is the smallest

5. Start back at the end, A[n] and repeat until the entire array is sorted
